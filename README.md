Libft
A custom C library that implements essential functions commonly used in C programming, such as memory management, string manipulation, and mathematical operations. This library is designed to help with common programming tasks and serves as a foundation for building more complex projects.

You can customize the description further depending on the exact functions and features of your library. Here's a more detailed version, if you want something a bit longer:

Libft
This is a personal C library (libft) containing implementations of basic functions that are often needed in C programming. It includes:

String manipulation functions (e.g., ft_strlen, ft_strcpy)
Memory management utilities (e.g., ft_memset, ft_bzero)
Mathematical functions (e.g., ft_isdigit, ft_abs)
Utilities for handling lists and data structures
The goal of this library is to provide reusable, efficient, and well-tested code that can be used in future projects, particularly for building custom implementations of standard C library functions.
